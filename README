To run this code you need to:
1. Make sure source-display folder exist on nginx folder (/etc/nginx/source-display).
2. Include source-display/config on your server block.
3. PLEASE check all the configurations in config file are correct for your server.
4. restart Nginx service

Now every *.phps you'll enter on your server will show the source code! including highlighting, numbering and numbering anchors.

Examples:
http://example.com/index.phps // Wil show the content of index.phps with highlight and numbering.

http://example.com/index.phps#100 // Same as above, only the page will jump to line 100.


USEFULL TIP: if you want to show the source of all the php files in the folder, run:
# for i in `ls | grep .php`; do ln -s `pwd`/"$i" `pwd`/"$i"s; done
